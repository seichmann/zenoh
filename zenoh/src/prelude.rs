//! A "prelude" for crates using the `zenoh` crate.
//!
//! This prelude is similar to the standard library's prelude in that you'll
//! almost always want to import its entire contents, but unlike the standard
//! library's prelude you'll have to do so manually.
//!
//! Examples:
//!
//! ```
//! use zenoh::prelude::*;
//! ```
